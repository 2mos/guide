# How to sit for longer hours ?

Sitting for longer hours might seem like a daunting task especially when you're not used to doing so...

However it isn't that difficult. Here's my *suggestion*

- Use the pomodoro mode on ypt or use pomofocus.io to track pomodoro sessions

The default of 25 mins focus and 5 mins break seems wayy too short and usually disturbs my flow. If you're like me, and don't know what to set as the duration of your pomodoro - follow this. 

Count the number of hours that you need to sit for a lecture at your coaching before a break is given and also the duration of the break. And use that as the duration of one pomodoro. 

For me it's 1.5 hours with 15 minutes of break, so I set that as the length of a single pomodoro session. 

Now depending on how long your pomodoro is, choose a minimum amount of pomodoros that you need to do daily which should be around the daily minimum target of 6 h. For me it's 4 pomodoros without fail. Min 4 pomos, aim - 8 pomos. 

Now study, if you can't even sit for 4 pomodoros then you reduce it by one for a day or two before increasing it. If that's not possible too then you need to get your ass whacked.

That's it, hope it helps.
