# How to sit for longer hours ?

Sitting for longer hours might seem like a daunting task especially when you're not used to doing so...

However it isn't that difficult. Here's my *suggestion*

Use the pomodoro mode on ypt or use pomofocus.io to track pomodoro sessions

The default of 25 mins focus and 5 mins break seems wayy too short and usually disturbs my flow. If you're like me, and don't know what to set as the duration of your pomodoro - follow this. 

Count the number of hours that you need to sit in lecture at your coaching before a break is given. Also count the duration of the break. Use that as the duration of one pomodoro. 

This works because you're already used to forcefully sitting for that long in class. In following the same routine at home, you're going to be able to better concentrate at class too. 

For me it's 1.5 hours with 15 minutes of break, so I set that as the length of a single pomodoro session. 

Now depending on how long your pomodoro is, choose a minimum amount of pomodoros that you need to do daily. This should be around the daily minimum target of 6 h. For me it's 4 pomodoros without fail. Min 4 pomos, aim - 8 pomos. 

Now study, if you can't even sit for 4 pomodoros then you reduce it by one for a day or two before increasing it. If that's not possible too then you need to get your ass beaten.

That's it, hope it helps üëç
