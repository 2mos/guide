# Your aim for this week would be 

1. Get a sleep schedule in place - sleep for 8 non compromise-able hours. No more, no less.
2. Make the most out of the remaining 16 hours in hand
3. Exercising after class - max one hour. 

Tune your expectations - you can't study 16 hours besides coaching, you can't even do that with coaching. 

You're going to have 12 hours left excluding coaching and sleep. Maximize your output in that time. Stop counting the number of hours that you need to study, instead **count the number of hours you're putting into waste** and then aim at reducing it by the day. Use your stopwatch and start it when you want to waste time. 

Students studying 16 hours daily are the exceptions and are exceptionally motivated. But you're not one of those gifted people to study that crazily. I agree they are the exceptions and you want to be an exception as well but you can be the exception by getting selected without compromising other aspects of your life. That would be a crazy feat! - getting the best of both worlds. 

Your current position - lazy, not studying a single hour daily. Studying for 6 and sleeping for 8 >> Studying for 0 and sleeping for 4 and tricking parents into thinking that you're studying and pretending that you're studying. When you were at school you slept for 8 hours went to school for 7, tuitions for 2. Still you could study more in those remaining hours than what you're doing now. Remember how you had notes for all subjects even with 10 subjects in hand. Now you're at 3 and still crippling. There were more chapters back then as well around 130+ right if you recall ? You were the ICSE student na? Did you forget your past and what sort of person you were ?

To sum up
- [ ] Sleep 8 hours daily
- [ ] Get a schedule in place, make it rigid and stick to it
- [ ] Count time wasted and aim at reducing it. The choice of counting time is up to you.
- [ ] Goal oriented and not time oriented study. You didn't count the number of hours to study back then but rather the number of hours left before bedtime. 
- [ ] Exercise daily
