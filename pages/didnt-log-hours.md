# I forgot to hit record, what do I do ? 
Happens to the best of us, in this case, take care to not repeat it because it causes me unncessary trouble. 

**Inform me in the chat** so that I can add an x hour exception to your name in my journal and not hand out an undeserved warning OR at worst, remove you by mistake. 

For your own record, you can follow these steps to add study hours but it's only visible to you and not me.

# I recorded, but YPT bugged out and didn't log

This usually happens when you turn off the screen which causes ypt to crash for some reason. I'm assuming that you've given YPT all the required permissions when you first installed the app. 

To avoid this from happening again instead of turning off the screen with the power button do this:

Start recording then click on the three dots on the top right corner. Select Facedown to screen off

Now the screen turns off when you place the phone face down. We'll have to live with this hack till ypt devs fix it rip.
