# Bugs I've noticed 

1. gtk 4 (rnote) dragging top bar, window doesn't correctly come under the cursor, but rather displaced to the left 
2. gtk 4, while trying to fullscreen by dragging to top, the backdrop is blue which is not similar to the windows 11 blur 
3. gtk 4 doesn't play well with windows 11 window snapping, like other apps have the top dropdown appearing to arrange windows in some order but gtk4 doesn't 
4. maybe powertoys not staying on admin and keyboard shortcuts not always working, not sure use powertoys more to tell 
5. [Screen QR Code Scanner Feature Request · Issue #30549 · microsoft/PowerToys · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/30549) Look through powertoys issues ig and try to replicate 
6. Xournalpp: can't scroll down when things are selected. To reproduce, select a bunch of stuff and then move cursor to bottom. Expected behavior, it should scroll
7. Xournalpp: while scribbling and not lifting the pen, and hitting ctrl+shift+e for eraser, the cursor turns into an eraser before even lifting the pen. Either make it turn into an eraser 
8. Xournalpp: when the app isn't fullscreen and f11 is pressed, it buggs out 

Linux: (probably do it in the end)
1. Nvidia and gpu on fedora not completely powering down without restarting 
2. Maybe switch to the open sourced nvidia driver on linux and pioneer nvidia 1660ti gpu dev
3. On fedora or smt the mute button color / power button color is not right
